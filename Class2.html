        Try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you get symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) again and you either:
have a <em>high temperature(normal:35<sup>o</sup>c)</em>
do not feel well enough to go to work or do your normal activities

        How to overcome?...
    </h4>
    <p>
        Try to <u>stay at home</u> and <u>avoid contact with other people</u> even if you've had a positive test result for COVID-19 before.
You probably have some immunity to the virus but it's not clear how long it lasts.
